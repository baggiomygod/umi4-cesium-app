# 1.1 The Structor of a three.js App

Before we can build a three.js app, we need to create a web page. We briefly discussed `(简单讨论)` how we're going to do that in the introduction`(简介)`, but let's take a deeper look now. as we mentioned in the last chapter`(正如我们在上一章中提到的)`, our goal here is to create the most basic, simple, unexciting webpage`平淡无奇的网页)` possible`(尽可能)`, whithout making any assumptions`(假设)` about a real-world web application that uses three.js might look like. By doing this, we ensure the code we write can be adapted`(适用于)` to work anywhere without too much effort`(努力)`.

> 翻译1：our goal here is to create the most basic, simple, unexciting webpage possible, without making any assumptions about what a real-world web application that uses three.js might look like. (我们的目标是尽可能地创建一个最基本、最简单、最平淡无奇的网页，不对使用three.js的真实网络应用做出任何假设。)

We'll create this basic web page out of just two files; index.html and styles/main.css.That's it. Open up the editor by pressing the \*\* button now and take a look at both of these files now.

## index.html

index.html is the root file of our app. it's the only file we open directly`(直接)` in the browser, and all CSS and javascript files are loaded via`(通过)` references`(引用)` from this file.
